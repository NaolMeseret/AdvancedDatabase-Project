## üìä Database Design

### Key Tables

| **Entity Name**      | **Description**                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UserUpload**       | Stores user-uploaded images.                                                             |
| **CustomerProducts** | Connects products to users and customers.                                                |
| **Login**            | Manages user authentication, roles, and contact information.                             |
| **OrderTable**       | Captures order details, including customer information.                                  |
| **Category**         | Organizes products into logical categories.                                              |
| **Product**          | Stores detailed product information, including attributes like price, brand, and images. |
| **Cart**             | Represents items added to a customer‚Äôs cart for purchase.                                |

### üîóRelationships

- **Users** upload products and place orders.
- **Categories** contain multiple products, and each product belongs to a single category.
- **Carts** link orders to products, allowing for detailed tracking of customer purchases.

## üìê Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The project includes an ERD to visually represent:

- Key entities.
- Relationships among users, products, orders, categories, and carts.

## üíæ SQL Implementation

### Database Schema

The database schema ensures:

- **Data integrity** through primary and foreign key constraints.
- **Efficient queries** for data retrieval and updates.
- **Logical relationships** between entities for seamless functionality.

### Example Queries

- Create and populate tables such as `UserUpload`, `Login`, `CustomerProducts`, and more.
- Retrieve product details, user data, and orders using optimized queries.

```sql
-- Example: Create a table for user uploads
CREATE TABLE UserUpload (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Image VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Example: Insert data into the UserUpload table
INSERT INTO UserUpload (UserID, Image) VALUES (1, 'profile1.jpg');
```

# üöÄ Advanced Techniques

## Vertical Fragmentation

- Divides tables by columns to optimize storage and query performance.
- Example: Splitting the UserUpload table into `{UserID, Image}`.

## Horizontal Fragmentation

- Divides tables by rows based on conditions.
- Example: UserUpload is split into:
  - Fragment 1: `Users with UserID <= 2`.
  - Fragment 2: `Users with UserID > 2`.

# Mixed Fragmentation

- Combines vertical and horizontal techniques for advanced optimization.
- Example: UserUpload split into row-based fragments while retaining only `{UserID, Image}` columns.
